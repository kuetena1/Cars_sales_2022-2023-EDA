## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze car sales insights for 2022 and 2023 to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can inform business decisions and strategies. This analysis will focus on identifying the top-selling car models, understanding seasonal trends, and exploring other factors influencing car sales. The dataset was provided by Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/missionjee/car-sales-report/data)

### Observations and recommendations

#### Observations<br />
The data indicates that more men bought the car than women in 2022 and 2023<br />

The top-selling Models are The Diamante, JETTA, Silhouette, RL, Passant, Ram Pickup, and LSA, suggesting the growing popularity for the years 2022 and 2023<br />

In 2023, the Montero Sport and A6 models disappeared from the top 10 models list in 2022 and were replaced by the LHS and 528i models<br />

SL, Cirrus, V70, and CLK Coupe are absent from the last ten car models sold in 2022, indicating possible improvement in sales or the discontinuation<br />

Pale white is the dominant color preference among consumers, regardless of body style or gender, for both 2022 and 2023 <br />

There are also seasonal patterns, with high sales in September, a dip in October, and another peak in November and December<br />

Each manufacturer has experienced a slight increase in sales from 2022 to 2023, reflecting maybe an improved economic condition and successful marking strategies<br />

#### Recommendations <br />

Prioritize and promote the top 10 car models as they have been consistent all over the years 2022 and 2023<br />

To capitalize on their increase in popularity, manufacturers can highlight the features and benefits of the Silhouette, Prizm, and Diamante in marketing campaigns<br />

For the new car models entering the top 10 car models in 2023, we can recommend that manufacturers keep an eye on their performance to understand their appeal and potential for sustained success<br />

Also, focus on year-end sales events in November and December to maximize the sales volumes during these months. <br />
